## Description

**Tech used: HTML, CSS, JS**

A simple rock, paper, scissors project. :fist:

The UI is built using HTML, CSS and JS (utilizing DOM methods). It responds to 
user interaction (through button clicks) to initate an event to play the game. 
Game logic is programmed in JS as well as the animations. Mild use of CSS is 
present to position the elements.
